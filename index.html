                <h1>Amazing Sunrise View</h1>
                <p>Sunrise is the moment when the upper rim of the Sun appears on the horizon in the morning. My eyes welcome the sunrise, that iris of fire so pretty in its mascara of pure light. The term can also refer to the entire process of the solar
                    disk crossing the horizon and its accompanying atmospheric effects. Although the Sun appears to "rise" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth
                    observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric
                    model in the 16th century. Architect Buckminster Fuller proposed the terms "sunsight" and "sunclipse" to better represent the heliocentric model, though the terms have not entered into common language. Astronomically, sunrise occurs
                    for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point. Twilight, the period in the morning during
                    which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn. The period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen. As a ray
                    of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to an observer, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles, changing the final color of the beam the viewer sees. </p>

                <h1>Stunning Sunset View</h1>
                <p>Sunset is the time in the evening when the sun disappears out of sight from the sky. The evening sun cast long shadows on the ground. The slanting rays of the setting sun gave a warm orange tinge to the sky. The sky was ablaze with the
                    fire of the setting sun. The night sky was aglow with bright city lights. When the sun has set, no candle can replace it. Sunset is so marvelous that even the sun itself watches it every day in the reflections of the infinite oceans!
                    A sunrise or sunset can be ablaze with brilliance and arouse all the passion, all the yearning, in the soul of the beholder. The apparent descent of the sun below the horizon. The glowing sun, a crisp circle in the bloody sky, illuminated
                    a quivering path across the water. It bathed the ocean's meek waves and the wispy clouds in a burning red. The time of the day when the sun waves goodbye, itâ€™s a time that casts magic on nature. Wonderful colours make up the backdrop
                    against which the celestial traveler leaves its daily scene. A divine glow fills the sky, while the sea, the clouds and the horizon sparkle with purple red light. The sun flies away for its nighttime migration and time stands still
                    as if this moment was never to come again. Words are not enough to describe what the senses feel. Only the hearts beat faster and the minds take long, imaginary trips. This isn't always easy but when written correctly can be absolutely
                    gorgeous. If you have two lovers watching the sunset together, highlight how beautiful it is. If your character is mourning the death of a loved one, highlight how the beauty of the sunset eventually is replaced by blackness.

                <h1>Dark Night View</h1>
                <p>Night views while traveling or of scenic locations are very popular subjects to photograph. In this chapter, you will learn how to capture a night view beautifully, accurately reproducing your impression of the actual scene. Night (also
                    described as night time, unconventionally spelled as "nite") is the period of ambient darkness from sunset to sunrise during each 24-hour day, when the Sun is below the horizon. The exact time when night begins and ends depends on
                    the location and varies throughout the year, based on factors such as season and latitude. The word can be used in a different sense as the time between bedtime and morning. In common communication, it is a farewell (sometimes lengthened
                    to "good night"), mainly when someone is going to sleep or leaving. Night is often associated with danger and evil, because of the psychological connection of night's all-encompassing darkness to the fear of the unknown and darkness's
                    hindrance of a major sensory system (the sense of sight). Nighttime is naturally associated with vulnerability and danger for human physical survival. Criminals, animals, and other potential dangers can be concealed by darkness. Midnight
                    has a particular importance in human imagination and culture. A clear night sky is great for photos. Moonless, clear nights can make the best night photographs. </p>
